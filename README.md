However, the regulatory environment continues evolving. The Texas Department of State Health Services periodically reviews kratom's status, and local municipalities retain authority to implement their own restrictions. Dallas city ordinances currently align with state law, allowing kratom sales through licensed retailers.

### Current Regulatory Framework

Texas law treats kratom as a legal botanical supplement, subject to general consumer protection regulations rather than controlled substance restrictions. This classification means:

- **Age restrictions** apply, with most vendors requiring customers to be 18 or older
- **Quality standards** follow FDA guidelines for dietary supplements
- **Labeling requirements** must include accurate ingredient lists and safety warnings
- **Vendor licensing** operates under standard business regulations

The **American Kratom Association** has worked extensively with Texas legislators to establish the Kratom Consumer Protection Act framework, which several states have adopted to regulate kratom sales while maintaining legal access.

### Municipal Considerations

While Dallas permits kratom sales, consumers should remain aware of potential changes in local ordinances. The city council periodically reviews supplement regulations, particularly following federal guidance updates or public health concerns.

**Staying informed about legal developments** protects consumers from inadvertent violations and helps maintain access to quality products through legitimate channels.
